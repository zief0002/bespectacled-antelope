    "text": "Questions\n\nImport the data and display the first several rows of data (not all of it). Use one of the paged table options in your YAML to ensure that this is printed nicely. All syntax for these commands should be hidden.\nRecode the gni_class variable by creating a dummy variable called high_gni. To create this dummy variable use the syntax below. Explain in words (not code) how the high_gni dummy variable is being coded.\n\n\nfertility = fertility |>\n  mutate(\n    high_gni = if_else(gni_class == \"Upper/Middle\" | gni_class == \"Upper\", 1, 0)\n  )\n\n\nCreate a well-formatted table that includes the mean infant mortality rate and the standard deviation of infant mortality rates for each of the two High GNI levels represented in the data. Display these in a summary table. All numerical output should be rounded to two decimal places. Also add an appropriate caption (the caption does not have to follow APA formatting). Do not display any syntax.\nUse the lm() function to fit a main effects linear model (unstandardized) regressing infant mortality on your dummy variable and female education level. Use the tidy() function from the broom package to display the model’s coefficient-level output. (Reminder: Do not display any syntax, only the model’s coefficient-level output.)\nUse a bulleted list to provide an interpretation of each estimated regression coefficient (including the intercept) from the regression you fitted in Question 3; one interpretation per list item.\nCreate a well-formatted table of the model’s coefficient tidy() output (e.g., using the gt() function from the {gt} package). In the final outputted table, the five column names should be “Predictor”, “B”, “SE”, “t”, and “p”, respectively. (The last four column names should be italicized since they are statistics.) All numerical output should be rounded to two decimal places, except the p-values, which should be rounded to three decimal places. Also add a caption. (2pts.)\nCreate a publication quality plot that displays the results from the fitted model. For this plot, put the female education level predictor on the x-axis. Display separate lines to show the effects for each level of the dummy-coded GNI variable. The two lines should be displayed using different linetypes or colors (or both) so that they can be easily differentiated in the plot. Be sure that the figure includes a caption using the fig-cap option in the code chunk. The plot should be centered on the page. Adjust the aspect ratio of the plot using fig-width and fig-height in the code chunk so that it looks good. Lastly, change the values of the output width/height (out-width, out-height) to change the size of the plot from the default values. (2pts.)\nUse a display equation to write the equation for the underlying regression model (including error and assumptions) using Greek letters, subscripts, and variable names. Also write the equation for the fitted least squares regression equation based on the output from lm(). Type these two equations in the same display equation, each on a separate line of text in your document, and align the equals signs. (2pts.)\nWrite the following sentence: “The estimated partial regression coefficient (\\(\\hat\\beta_\\mathrm{Female~Education}\\)) is \\(x\\).” In this sentence, use an inline code chunk to replace \\(x\\) with the value for the fitted coefficient from the fitted equation. In this code chunk, do not just write in the value for the coefficient, but use syntax to extract the value from the tidy() output. (Hint: Google “R extract element from dataframe”.) (2pts.)\nCompute the sum of squared residuals for the fitted regression. Although you can use the anova() function to check your work, compute this value by actually using R syntax to carry out the computation, \\(\\sum(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\\). Show the syntax you used in your document.\nWrite a sentence that includes two references in an inline citation. This should also generate the actual references when you knit your document. One of the two references should be the Fox textbook. The other should be a journal article of your choice. You can choose the topic of the sentence and how the two references are used in the citation. (Note the references do not actually have to pertain to what is written in the sentence. This is just an exercise in using the bibliography tools in Markdown.) Specify an appropriate CSL file so that the references and citations are in APA format. (If you want to use a citation style that is different from APA, say for a specific journal, use the appropriate CSL file, and indicate that on the assignment.) Both the BIB and CSL files should be included in your project’s assets directory. (2pts.)"

In this study, we will fit the same candidate models that Snipes and Taylor fitted in their analysis, however we will be using a different data set (e.g., our data includes more regions than Snipes and Taylor’s data). We will also make one change in the analysis, and that is we will treat vintage as a continuous variable; we won’t categorize it like Snipes and Taylor did. By using a different set of data and making slightly different analytic decisions we can more vigorously evaluate the underlying working hypotheses.\nFit the same nine candidate models that Snipes and Taylor fitted in their analysis, using the wine.csv data. In these models use wine rating (rating) as the outcome. Remember to treat vintage as a continuous variable in the models that include it.

    "text": "Effect of Religious Service Attendance\nYou will begin the analysis by examining the effect of religious service attendance on support of same-sex marriage. Because the data for this predictor come from a Likert scale (ordinal in nature), we need to examine whether we can treat it as a continuous predictor in the model, or whether we should treat it as categorical.\n\nBegin by computing the empirical proportion of people that support same-sex marriage for each of the attendance categories. Create a line plot that shows the relationship between proportion of support and attendance.\n\nBased on the plot you just created, the relationship between proportion of support and attendance seems linear. Because of this, we can treat the Likert data as continuous; using a line (or polynomial) to fit the relationship. The only caution being that when interpreting a slope, we say something like, “a one-unit difference in \\(X\\) is associated with a \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\)-unit difference in \\(Y\\)”. For ordinal (Likert) data a one-unit difference in \\(X\\) really indicates a shift from one category to the next highest category.\n\nFit two logistic models to the data using religious service attendance. In the first model, only include the linear effect of attendance. In the second model, include both a linear and quadratic effect to predict variation in support for same-sex marriage. Which model should be adopted (linear or quadratic)? Justify your response by providing any statistical evidence you used in reaching your decision. (Note: The model you adopt here will be henceforth referred to as Model 1.)\n\n\n\n\nWrite the fitted equation for Model 1. (Don’t forget to include all appropriate subscripts. Also define any terms in the model that are ambiguous.)\nUse the fitted equation for Model 1 to predict the (a) log-odds, (b) odds, and (c) probability of someone supporting same-sex marriage if that person attends religious services almost every week."

By referring to this matrix, clearly indicate the order in which you will add covariates into the model.\n\nFit three logistic models based on the order of importance of the three covariates that also include the effects of religious attendance, and denomination. For example, the first of these three models would include the effects of religious attendance, denomination, and the most important covariate you identifed in Question 8. The second model would include the effects of religious attendance, denomination, and the two most important covariates you identified. Finally, the third model would include the effects of religious attendance, denomination, and all three covariates.\n\nWhich of these three models should be adopted as you final model (or set of models)? Justify your response by providing any statistical evidence you used in reaching your decision. (2pts.)\nCreate a table of results from your set of fitted models. This table should include Models 1–3 and also any model(s) you adopted from the previous question. Like other regression tables you have created, be sure to include the estimated coefficients and standard errors for each of the effects included in the models.

This is a general function that allows us to customize many parts of the table (akin to theme() in ggplot()).\nTo do this we use the style= argument and call the cell_borders() function within tab_style(). Here we remove all borders (top, bottom, left, and right) by using sides=\"all\" and setting style=NULL. The tab_style() function also requires the argument locations=. We give this argument the function cell_body() which we provide the column and row numbers that we want to remove the borders from.

Then create a code chunk in which you create a scatterplot of infant mortality rates (y-axis) versus female education level (x-axis).\n\nIt is a good idea to include a label in the chunk options for each plot you create. A label is the name of this code chunk. (Any code chunk, even if it is not a plot, can have a label.) In the plot below, the chunk’s label is fig-scatterplot.\n\n\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-scatterplot\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\"\nggplot(data = fertility, aes(x = educ_female, y = infant_mortality)) +\n   geom_point()\n```\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\n\n\n\n\nNotice that by labeling this chunk, the figure is numbered in the document. We also added a caption using the fig-cap: option.\n\n\nFigure Size\nThere are a couple other chunk options for figures that help set the aspect ratio and size of the figure in your document. The aspect ratio is the ratio of a figure’s width to its height. We set this using the fig-width: and fig-height: chunk options. (The default value for both is 6; thus the figure appears square.) Below we change these so that the figure appears wider than it is tall.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-scatterplot-2\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\"\n#| fig-width: 9\n#| fig-height: 5\nggplot(data = fertility, aes(x = educ_female, y = infant_mortality)) +\n   geom_point()\n```\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to change the aspect ratio when you have legends or when you are using {patchwork} to stack or put multiple figures next to each other. Many times you need to find a good aspect ratio though trial-and-error of trying different values.\n\nThe actual size of the figure in the document is independent of the aspect ratio and can be set using the out-width: or out-height: chunk option. These options take a character string of the direct size (in HTML documents this is typically in pixels) or of the percentage of the output width/height. Here we keep the same aspect ratio, but make the figure smaller by setting the figure width to 40% of the document’s width.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-scatterplot-3\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\"\n#| fig-width: 9\n#| fig-height: 5\n#| out-width: \"40%\"\nggplot(data = fertility, aes(x = educ_female, y = infant_mortality)) +\n   geom_point()\n```\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\n\n\n\n\n:::protip If you set the aspect ratio of the figure, you need only set out-width: or out-height:. You don’t need to set both as the other will be determined by the aspect ratio. ::"

For example, consider writing the following sentence in an analysis of the fertility.csv data.\n\nThe mean infant mortality rate is 26.05% (SD = 23.98).\n\nRather than computing these values and then transposing the values into the sentence, we can use inline code chunks to directly compute and write the values in the sentence. Here is some syntax we could use:\nThe mean infant mortality rate is `r mean(fertility$infant_mortality)` (SD = `r sd(fertility$infant_mortality)`).\nThis produces the following sentence in the rendered document:\n\nThe mean infant mortality rate is 26.05 (SD = 23.982719).\n\n\n\nRounding\nThere are several ways to set the rounding to two decimal places. One is to embed the computation in the round() function. For example, in the first inline chunk we could use: round(mean(fertility$infant_mortality), 2).\nYou can also do this in a separate code chunk and then call the values in the inline computation (as suggested in the Quarto Computations Tutorial)."

    "text": "Better Typesetting of Equations\nWhen we typeset equations, there are a couple things we should do:\n\nUse variable names that make sense to our reader, rather than their name in our dataset/R. For example “Female Education Level” is a better name than “educ_female”.\n\nThis means we will need to add spaces into our variable names in the mathematical expression. If you tried that earlier, you found out that just hitting the spacebar does not produce a space in the outputted expression. We need to include a tilde (~) every time you want a space. So to get the name “Female Education Level” we need to use the following in our equation:\n$$\nFemale~Education~Level\n$$\n\nVariable names should also be typeset using normal text rather than italic (the default in mathematical expressions).\n\nTo achieve this, we have to embed the text we want to be normal in the syntax \\mathrm{}. This typesets the text in a roman font (normal text). For example:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Female~Education~Level}\n$$\nYou can also use \\mathit{} (italics), \\mathbf{} (bold), \\mathtt{} (typewriter text), and \\mathcal{} (caligraphy; this is useful for the “N” we use to indicate a normal distribution).\n\nHyphens need special syntax since a hyphen would be interpreted as a minus sign. In typesetting, the minus sign is longer than the hyphen symbol.\n\nIf you want to include a hyphen, we need to include it in \\mbox{}. For example, to add a hyphen in our variable name to get “Female Education-Level”, we use:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Female~Education\\mbox{-}Level}\n$$\n\nUpdate your fitted equation from before to include spaces in variable names. Also be sure the variable names are written in normal font."

    "text": "Log-Likelihood\nThe likelihood values are quite small since we are multiplying several probability densities (values between 0 and 1) together. Since it is hard to work with these smaller values, in practice, we often compute and work with the natural logarithm of the likelihood. So in our example, \\(\\mathcal{L}_1 = 4.71647 \\times 10^{-50}\\) and the log-likelihood would be:\n\n# Log-likelihood for Model 1\nlog(4.71647e-50)\n\n[1] -113.5782\n\n\nSimilarly, we can compute the log-likelihood for Model 2 as:\n\n# Log-likelihood for Model 2\nlog(5.231164e-48)\n\n[1] -108.8695\n\n\nWe typically denote log-likelihood using a scripted lower-case “l” (\\(\\mathcal{l}\\)). Here,\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathcal{l}_1 &= -113.5782 \\\\[1ex]\n\\mathcal{l}_2 &= -108.8695 \\\\[1ex]\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nNote that the logarithm of a decimal will be negative, so the log-likelihood will be a negative value. Less negative log-likelihood values correspond to higher likelihood values, which indicate more empirical support. Here Model 2 has a less negative log-likelihood value (\\(-108\\)) than Model 1 (\\(-113\\)), which indicates there is more empirical support for Model 2 than Model 1.\nWe can also express the likelihood ratio using log-likelihoods. To do so we take the natural logarithm of the likelihood ratio. We also re-write it using the rules of logarithms from algebra.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\ln(\\mathrm{LR}) &= \\ln \\bigg(\\frac{\\mathcal{L}_2}{\\mathcal{L}_1}\\bigg) \\\\[2ex]\n&= \\ln \\big(\\mathcal{L}_2\\big) - \\ln \\big(\\mathcal{L}_1\\big)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThat is, we can find an equivalent relative support metric to the LR based on the log-likelihoods by computing the difference between them. For our example:\n\n# Difference in log-likelihoods\nlog(5.231164e-48) - log(4.71647e-50)\n\n[1] 4.708743\n\n# Equivalent to ln(LR)\nlog(5.231164e-48 / 4.71647e-50)\n\n[1] 4.708743\n\n\nUnfortunately, this difference doesn’t have the same interpretational value as the LR does, bcause this difference is in log-units. In order to get that interpretation back, we need to exponentiate (the reverse function of the logarithm) the difference:\n\n# Exponentiate the difference in log-likelihoods\nexp(4.708743)\n\n[1] 110.9127\n\n\nModel 2 has 110.9 times the empirical support than Model 1.\n\nMathematics of Log-Likelihood\nWe can express the log-likelihood of the regression residuals mathematically by taking the natural logarithm of the likelihood we computed earlier:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\ln \\Bigl(\\mathcal{L}(\\beta_0, \\beta_1 | \\mathrm{data})\\Bigr) &= \\ln \\Biggl( \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{\\epsilon}\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\right]^n \\times \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\epsilon_1^2}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}}\\right] \\times  \\\\\n&~~~~~~ \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\epsilon_2^2}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}}\\right] \\times \\ldots \\times \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\epsilon_n^2}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}}\\right] \\Biggr) \\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nUsing our rules for logarithms and re-arranging gives,\n\\[\n\\mathcal{l}(\\beta_0, \\beta_1 | \\mathrm{data}) = -\\frac{n}{2} \\times \\ln (2\\pi\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}} \\times \\sum \\epsilon_i^2\n\\]\nExamining this equation, we see that the log-likelihood is a function of \\(n\\), \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\) and the sum of squared residuals (SSR)1. We can of course, re-express this using the the regression parameters:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{l}(\\beta_0, \\beta_1 | \\mathrm{data}) = -\\frac{n}{2} \\times \\ln (2\\pi\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}} \\times \\sum \\big[Y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1(X_i)\\big]^2\n\\]\nAnd, again, since \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\) is a function of the regression coefficients and \\(n\\), this means that the only variables in the log-likelihood function are the coefficients."

    "text": "Shortcut: The logLik() Function\nThe logLik() function can be used to obtain the log-likelihood directly from a fitted model object. For example, to find the log-likelihood for Model 1, we can use:\n\n# Compute log-likelihood for Model 1\nlogLik(lm.1)\n\n'log Lik.' -113.5472 (df=3)\n\n\nThe df output tells us how many total parameters are being estimated in the model. In our case this is three (\\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{SAT}}\\), and \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\)). What is more important to us currently, is the log-likelihood value; \\(\\mathcal{l}_1=-113.55\\).\nThis value is slightly different than the log-likelihood we just computed of \\(-113.58\\). This is not because of rounding in this case. It has to do with how the model is being estimated; the logLik() function assumes the parameters are being estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) rather than ordinary least squares (OLS). We will learn more about this in the next set of notes, but for now, we will just use logLik() to compute the log-likelihood.\nHere we compute the log-likelihood for Model 2 using the logLik() function. We also use the output to compute the likelihood, and the likelihood ratio between Model 2 and Model 1\n\n# Compute log-likelihood for Model 2\nlogLik(lm.2)\n\n'log Lik.' -108.7964 (df=4)\n\n# Compute likelihood for Model 2\nexp(logLik(lm.2)[1])\n\n[1] 5.627352e-48\n\n# Compute LR\nexp( logLik(lm.2)[1] - logLik(lm.1)[1] )\n\n[1] 115.6734\n\n\nBecause the output from logLik() includes extraneous information (e.g., df), we use indexing (square brackets) to extract only the part of the output we want. In this case, the [1] extracts the log-likelihood value from the logLik() output (ignoring the df part).\nAlso of note is that the df for Model 2 is four, indicating that this model is estimating four parameters (\\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{SAT}}\\), \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{Sector}}\\), and \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\)). The value of df in the logLik() output is a quantification of the model’s complexity. Here Model 2 (df = 4) is more complex than Model 1 (df = 3).\nAs we consider using the likelihood ratio (LR) or the difference in log-likelihoods for model selection, we also need to consider the model complexity. In our example, the likelihood ratio of 115.7 (computed using logLik()) indicates that Model 2 has approximately 116 times the empirical support than Model 1. But, Model 2 is more complex than Model 1, so we would expect that it would be more empirically supported.\nIn this case, with a LR of 116, it seems like the data certainly support adopting Model 2 over Model 1, despite the added complexity of Model 2. But what if the LR was 10? Would that be enough additional support to warrant adopting Model 2 over Model 1? What about a LR of 5?"

For example, in our standard normal distribution outcomes near zero are more probable than outcomes near 1, which are more probable than outcomes near 2, etc. Since we can’t use probability to do this (remember the probability of each outcome is the same, namely 0), we use something called probability density. This is akin to a relative probability, so outcomes with a higher probability density are more likely than outcomes with a lower probability density.\nThe mapping of all the outcomes to their probability densities is called a probability density function (PDF). Thus the equation or “bell-shaped” curve describing the standard normal distribution in Figure 1 is technically a PDF Here are some laws governing PDFs:\n\nProbability densities are always positive.\nThe probability of an outcome x between a and b equals the integral (area under the curve) between a and b of the probability density function.

    "section": "pnorm(): Computing Cumulative Probability Density",
    "text": "pnorm(): Computing Cumulative Probability Density\nThe function pnorm() computes the area under the PDF curve from \\(-\\infty\\) to some x-value. (Sometimes this is referred to as the cumulative probability density of x.) It is important to note that the PDF is defined such that the entire area under the curve is equal to 1. Because of this, we can also think about using area under the curve as an analog to probability in a continuous distribution.\nFor example, we might ask about the probability of observing an x-value that is less than or equal to 65 given it is from a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution. Symbolically, we want to find:\n\\[\nP\\bigg(x \\leq 65 \\mid \\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\bigg)\n\\]\nThis is akin to finding the proportion of the area under the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) PDF that is to the left of 65. The figure below shows a graphical depiction of the cumulative probability density for \\(x=65\\).\n\n\nCode\n# Create dataset\nfig_03 = data.frame(\n  X = seq(from = 10, to = 90, by = 0.01)\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(\n    Y = dnorm(x = X, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n    )\n\n# Filter out X<=65\nshaded = fig_03 %>%\n  filter(X <= 65)\n\n# Create plot\nggplot(data = fig_03, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shaded, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlab(\"X\") +\n  ylab(\"Probability density\") +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Plot of the probability density function (PDF) for a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution. The area that is shaded grey (relative to the total area under the PDF) represents the cumulative probability density for \\(x=65\\).\n\n\n\n\nWe can compute the cumulative probability density using the pnorm() function. The “p” stand for “probability”.\n\n# Find P(x<=65 | N(50,10) )\npnorm(q = 65, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n[1] 0.9331928\n\n\nWe can interpret this as:\n\nThe probability of observing an x-value that is less than or equal to 65 (if it is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10) is 0.933.\n\nIn mathematics, the area under a curve is called an integral. The grey-shaded area in the previous figure can also be expressed as an integral of the probability density function:\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{65} p(x) dx\n\\]\nwhere \\(p(x)\\) is the PDF for the normal distribution.\nThe most common application for finding the cumulative density is to compute a p-value. The p-value is just the area under the distribution (curve) that is AT LEAST as extreme as some observed value. For example, assume we computed a test statistic of \\(z=2.5\\), and were evaluating whether this was different from 0 (two-tailed test). Graphically, we want to determine the proportion of the area under the PDF that is shaded grey in the figure below.\n\n\nCode\n# Create data\nfig_04 = data.frame(\n  X = seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 0.01)\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(\n    Y = dnorm(x = X, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n    )\n\n# Filter data for shading\nshade_01 = fig_04 %>%\n  filter(X >= 2.5)\n\nshade_02 = fig_04 %>%\n  filter(X <= -2.5)\n\n# Create plot\nggplot(data = fig_04, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shade_01, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shade_02, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlab(\"z\") +\n  ylab(\"Probability density\") +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Plot of the probability density function (PDF) for the standard normal distribution (\\(M=0\\), \\(SD=1\\)). The cumulative density representing the p-value for a two-tailed test evaluating whether \\(\\mu=0\\) using an observed mean of 2.5 is also displayed.\n\n\n\n\nIf the distribution of the test statistic is normally distributed, we can use pnorm() to compute the p-value. If we assume the test statistic, z, has been scaled to use standardized units, the standard deviation we use in pnorm() will be sd=1. The mean is based on the value being tested in the null hypothesis. In most null hypotheses, we are testing a difference from 0 (e.g., \\(H_0: \\mu=0\\), \\(H_0: \\beta=0\\)), so we would use mean=0 in the pnorm() function.\nRemember, pnorm() computes the proportion of the area under the curve TO THE LEFT of a particular value. Here we will compute the area to the left of \\(-2.5\\) and then double it to produce the actual p-value. (We can double it because the normal distribution is symmetric so the area to the left of \\(-2.5\\) is the same as the area to the right of \\(+2.5\\).)\n\n# Compute the p-value based on z=2.5\n2 * pnorm(q = -2.5, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] 0.01241933\n\n\nWe interpret this p-value as:\n\nThe probability of observing a statistic at least as extreme as 2.5, assuming the null hypothesis is true, is 0.012. This is evidence against the null hypothesis since the data are inconsistent with the assumed hypothesis.\n\n\n\nqnorm(): Computing Quantiles\nThe qnorm() function is essentially the inverse of the pnorm() function. The pnorm() function computes the cumulative probability GIVEN a particular quantile (x-value). The qnorm() function computes the quantile GIVEN a cumulative probability. For example, in the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50, 10)\\) distribution, half of the area under the PDF is below the x-value (quantile) of 50.\nTo use the qnorm() function to give the x-value (quantile) that defines the lower 0.5 of the area under the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50, 10)\\) PDF, the syntax would be:\n\n# Find the quantile that has a cumulative density of 0.5 in the N(50, 10) distribution\nqnorm(p = 0.5, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n[1] 50\n\n\n\n\n\nrnorm(): Generating Random Observations\nThe rnorm() function can be used to generate random observations drawn from a specified normal distribution. Aside from the mean= and sd= arguments, we also need to specify the number of observations to generate by including the argument n=. For example, to generate 15 observations drawn from a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution we would use the following syntax:\n\n# Generate 15 observations from N(50,10)\nset.seed(100)\nrnorm(n = 15, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n [1] 44.97808 51.31531 49.21083 58.86785 51.16971 53.18630 44.18209 57.14533\n [9] 41.74741 46.40138 50.89886 50.96274 47.98366 57.39840 51.23380\n\n\nThe set.seed() function sets the state of the random number generator used in R so that the results are reproducible. If you don’t use set.seed() you will get a different set of observations each time you run rnorm(). Here we set the starting seed to 100, but you can set this to any integer you want."

    "text": "Mean Squares are Variance Estimates\nMean squares are also estimates of the variance. Consider the computational formula for the sample variance,\n\\[\n\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum(Y - \\bar{Y})^2}{n-1}\n\\]\nThis is the total sum of squares divided by the total df. The variance of the outcome variable is interpreted as the average amount of variation in the outcome variable (in the squared metric). Thus, it is also referred to as the mean square total.\nWhen we compute an F-statistic, we are finding the ratio of two different variance estimates—one based on the model (explained variance) and one based on the error (unexplained variance). Under the null hypothesis that \\(\\rho^2 = 0\\), we are assuming that all the variance is unexplained. In that case, our F-statistic would be close to zero. When the model explains a significant amount of variation, the numerator gets larger relative to the denominator and the F-value is larger.\nThe mean squared error (from the anova() output) plays a special role in regression analysis. It is the variance estimate for the conditional distributions of the residuals in our visual depiction of the distributional assumptions of the residuals underlying linear regression.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Visual Depiction of the Distributional Assumptions of the Residuals Underlying Linear Regression\n\n\n\n\nRecall that we made implicit assumptions about the conditional distributions of the residuals, namely that they were identically and normally distributed with a mean of zero and some variance. Based on the estimate of the mean squared error, the variance of each of these distributions is 58.5.\nWhile the variance is a mathematical convenience, the standard deviation is often a better descriptor of the variation in a distribution since it is measured in the original metric. The standard deviation fro the residuals (error) is 7.6. Because the residuals are statistics (summaries computed from sample data), their standard deviation is referred to as a “standard error”.\n\nThe residual standard error (RSE) is sometimes referred to as the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n\n\n# Compute RMSE\nsqrt(58.5)\n\n[1] 7.648529\n\n\nWhy is this value important? It gives the expected variation in the conditional residual distributions, which is a measure of the average amount of error. For example, since all of the conditional distributions of the residuals are assumed to be normally distributed, we would expect that 95% of the residuals would fall between \\(\\pm2\\) standard errors from 0; or, in this case, between \\(-15.3\\) and \\(+15.3\\). Observations with residuals that are more extreme may be regression outliers.\nMore importantly, it is a value that we need to estimate in order to specify the model."

    "text": "Residual Plot: Another Way to Spot Nonlinearity\nSometimes, the nonlinear relationship is difficult to detect from the scatterplot of Y versus X. Often it helps to fit the linear model and then examine the assumption of linearity in the residuals. It is sometimes easier to detect nonlinearity in the scatterplot of the residuals versus the fitted values.\n\n# Fit linear model\nlm.1 = lm(grad ~ 1 + sat, data = mn)\n\n# Residual plot: Scatterplot\nresidual_plots(lm.1, type = \"s\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Standardized residuals versus the fitted values for a model regressing six-year graduation rates on median SAT scores. The line \\(Y=0\\) (black) and the loess smoother (blue) are also displayed.\n\n\n\n\nThis plot suggests that the assumption of linearity may be violated; the average residual is not zero at each fitted value. For low fitted values it appears as though the average residual may be less than zero, for moderate fitted values it appears as though the average residual may be more than zero, and for high fitted values it appears as though the average residual may be less than zero.\nNotice that the pattern displayed in the residuals is consistent with the pattern of the observed data in the initial scatterplot (Figure 1). If we look at the data relative to the regression smoother we see that there is not even vertical scatter around this line. At low and high SAT scores the observed data tends to be below the regression line (the regression is over-estimating the average graduation rate), while for moderate SAT scores the observed data tends to be above the regression line (the regression is under-estimating the average graduation rate)."

    "text": "Are the Assumptions More Tenable for this Model?\nMore important than whether the p-value is small, is whether including the quadratic effect improved the assumption violation we noted earlier. To evaluate this, we will examine the two residual plots for the quadratic model: (1) a density plot of the standardized residuals; and (2) a plot of the standardized residuals versus the fitted values.\n\n# Residual plots\nresidual_plots(lm.2)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Residual plots for the quadratic model regressing six-year graduation rate on median SAT scores. LEFT: Density plot of the standardized residuals. The confidence envelope for a normal reference distribution (blue shaded area) is also displayed. RIGHT: Standardized residuals versus the fitted values. The line \\(Y=0\\) (black) and confidence envelope (grey shaded area) for that line are shown, along with the loess smoother (blue) esimating the mean pattern of the residuals.\n\n\n\n\nThe plot of the standardized residuals versus the fitted values suggests that the residuals for the quadratic model are far better behaved; indicating much more consistency with the assumption that the average residual is zero at each fitted value than the linear model. This is the evidence that we would use to justify retaining the quadratic effect in the model. This plot also suggests that the homoskedasticity assumption is tenable. Finally, the empirical density of the residuals also seems consistent with the assumption of normality for this model.\nReminder: The assumption of independence can’t be evaluated from the plots, but is vary important given we rely on it to be able to correctly compute the likelihood. From the design of the study, we haven’t sampled the schools randomly, nor randomly assigned the schools to their levels of the predictor(s), so we can’t infer independence from that. So the question becomes, does knowing the graduation rate of a school in the population give us information about the graduation rate for other schools in the population with the same median SAT score? If the answer is “no”, then we can call the independence assumption tenable. If the answer is “yes”, the independence assumption is violated and we should not use the lm() function or believe that results from that function are valid."

    "text": "Graphical Interpretation\nTo plot the fitted equation, we use the geom_function() layer to add the fitted curve. (Note that we can no longer use geom_abline() since the addition of the polynomial effect implies that a line is no longer suitable.) This layer takes the argument fun= which describes a function that will be plotted as a line. To describe a function, use the syntax function(){...}. Here we use this syntax to describe the function of x (which in the ggplot() global layer is mapped to the sat variable). The fitted equation is then also written in terms of x and placed inside the curly braces. (Note that it is best to be more exact in the coefficient values—don’t round—when you create this plot as even minor differences can grossly change the plot.)\n\n# Scatterplot\nggplot(data = mn, aes(x = sat, y = grad)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_function(\n    fun = function(x) {-366.34 + 62.72*x - 2.15 * x^2},\n    color = \"#0072b2\"\n    ) +\n    theme_light() +\n  xlab(\"Estimated median SAT score (in hundreds)\") +\n  ylab(\"Six-year graduation rate\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Scatterplot of six-year graduation rate versus median SAT score. The fitted curve from the quadratic regression model (blue line) is also displayed.\n\n\n\n\nThe fitted curve helps us interpret the nature of the relationship between median SAT scores and graduation rates. The effect of median SAT score on graduation rate depends on SAT score (definition of an interaction). For schools with low SAT scores, the effect of SAT score on graduation rate is positive and fairly high. For schools with high SAT scores, the effect of SAT score on graduation rate remains positive, but it has a smaller effect on graduation rates; the effect diminishes."

    "section": "Algebraic Interpretation",
    "text": "Algebraic Interpretation\nFrom algebra, you may remember that the coefficient in front of the quadratic term (\\(-2.2\\)) informs us of whether the quadratic is an upward-facing U-shape, or a downward-facing U-shape. Since our term is negative, the U-shape is downward-facing. This is consistent with what we saw in the plot. What the algebra fails to show is that, within the range of SAT scores in our data, we only see part of the entire downward U-shape.\nThis coefficient also indicates whether the U-shape is skinny or wide. Although “skinny” and “wide” are only useful as relative comparisons. Algebraically, the comparison is typically to a quadratic coefficient of 1, which is generally not useful in our interpretation. The intercept and coefficient for the linear term help us locate the U-shape in the coordinate plane (moving it right, left, up, or down from the origin). You could work all of this out algebraically. You can see how different values of these coefficients affect the curve on Wikipedia.\nWhat can be useful is to find where the minimum (upward facing U-shape) or maximum (downward facing U-shape) occurs. This point is referred to as the vertex of the parabola and can be algebraically determined. To do this we determine the x-location of the vertex by\n\\[\nx_\\mathrm{Vertex} = -\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_1}{2 \\times \\hat\\beta_2}\n\\]\nwhere, \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) is the estimated coefficient for the linear term and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_2\\) is the estimated coefficient for the quadratic term. The y coordinate for the vertex can then be found by substituting the x-coordinate into the fitted equation. For our example,\n\\[\nx_\\mathrm{Vertex} = -\\frac{62.72}{2 \\times -2.15} = 14.58\n\\]\nand\n\\[\ny_\\mathrm{Vertex} = -366.34 + 62.72(14.58) - 2.15(14.58^2) = 91.08\n\\]\nThis suggests that at a median SAT score of 1458 we predict a six-year graduate rate of 91.08. This x-value also represents the value at which the direction of the effect changes. In our example recall that for higher values of SAT the effect of SAT on graduation rate was diminishing. This is true for schools with median SAT scores up to 1458. For schools with higher SAT scores the effect of SAT score on graduation rate would theoretically be negative, and would be more negative for higher values.\nThis is all theoretical as our data only includes median SAT scores up to 1400. Everything past that value (including the vertex) is extrapolation. Extrapolation is exceedingly sketchy when we start fitting non-linear models. For example, do we really think that the average graduation rate for schools with a median SAT scores higher than 1458 would actually be smaller than for schools at 1458? It is more likely that the effect just flattens out."

    "text": "Summarizing the Adopted Interaction Model\nAgain, we will obtain model- and coefficient-level output and use those to summarize the results of the fitted model.\n\n# Model-level output\nglance(lm.4)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nModel 4 explains 90.6% of the variation in graduation rates, an increase of 0.9 percentage points from Model 3. The residual standard error for Model 4, \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\epsilon}=5.64\\), has also decreased from that for Model 3 indicating that this model has less error than Model 3.\nThe coefficient-level output is:\n\n# Coefficient-level output\ntidy(lm.4)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe can use this to obtain the fitted equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Graduation~Rate}_i} = -&413.80 + 71.65(\\mathrm{SAT}_i) - 2.54(\\mathrm{SAT}^2_i) + \\\\\n&35.07(\\mathrm{Public}_i) - 4.11(\\mathrm{SAT}_i)(\\mathrm{Public}_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThe interaction tells us that the effect of SAT on graduation rate differs for public and private institutions. Rather than parsing this difference by trying to interpret each of the effects, we will again plot the fitted curves for private and public institutions, and use the plot to aid our interpretation.\nPrivate Institutions\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Graduation~Rate}_i} &= -413.80 + 71.65(\\mathrm{SAT}_i) - 2.54(\\mathrm{SAT}^2_i) + 35.07(0) - 4.11(\\mathrm{SAT}_i)(0) \\\\\n&= -413.80 + 71.65(\\mathrm{SAT}_i) - 2.54(\\mathrm{SAT}^2_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nPublic Institutions\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Graduation~Rate}_i} &= -413.80 + 71.65(\\mathrm{SAT}_i) - 2.54(\\mathrm{SAT}^2_i) + 35.07(1) - 4.11(\\mathrm{SAT}_i)(1) \\\\\n&= -378.73 + 67.54(\\mathrm{SAT}_i) - 2.54(\\mathrm{SAT}^2_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nComparing these two fitted equations, we see that not only is the intercept in the two fitted models different (due to the main effect of sector), but now the coefficient for the interaction between sector and the linear effect of SAT also differs; it is lower for public institutions (by 4.11 units) than for private institutions. The quadratic effect of SAT is the same for both public and private institutions. (If we had adopted the model with both interaction terms, the quadratic effect would also be different across sectors.)\nTo visualize the effect of SAT, we can again plot each fitted curve by including each in a separate geom_function() layer.\n\n# Plot of the fitted model\nggplot(data = mn, aes(x = sat, y = grad)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0) +\n    geom_function(\n      fun = function(x) {-378.73 + 67.54 * x - 2.54 * x^2},\n      color = \"#2ec4b6\",\n      linetype = \"dashed\"\n      ) +\n  geom_function(\n    fun = function(x) {-413.80 + 71.65 * x - 2.54 * x^2},\n    color = \"#ff9f1c\",\n    linetype = \"solid\"\n    ) +\n    theme_light() +\n  xlab(\"Estimated median SAT score (in hundreds)\") +\n  ylab(\"Six-year graduation rate\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Six-year graduation rate as a function of median SAT score for private (orange, solid line) and public (blue, dashed line) institutions.\n\n\n\n\nThe curvature (linear and quadratic slopes) of the lines now looks different for the two sectors because of the interaction term. (Note that interactions with the linear effect of SAT or the quadratic effect of SAT contribute to a change in the curvature.) For both sectors, the effect of median SAT on graduation rates is positive (institutions with higher median SAT scores tend to have higher graduation rates. But, this effect diminishes for institutions with increasingly higher SAT scores. Private schools have higher graduation rates, on average, than public schools for all levels of median SAT score. Moreover, this difference in graduation rates is getting larger at higher levels of SAT (that is the interaction!)."
