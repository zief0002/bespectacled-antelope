The index includes indicators such as the sanctions available to the appropriate agencies in each state, the size of the state’s pollution monitoring program, and the size of the state’s program budget, as well as a variety of specific policy indicators.\ncorrupt: Aggregate number of convictions (per 100 officials) during the Reagan Administration (between 1981 and 1987). Aggregating across several years helps eliminate spikes that occur because a single investigation may result in multiple convictions. The average state had 1.42 convictions per 100 officials over that period.\nwealth: Gross state product per capita, in thousands of dollars. This is an indicator of a state’s financial resources.\ntoxic_waste: Natural logarithm of the total tons of toxic waste emitted in air, water based on the U.S. EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory. Higher values indicate a more severe problem.\ndem_party_control: Represents the average amount of Democratic Party control of state political institutions in the 1980s measured as a proportion.\ninterparty_comp: Holbrook and Van Dunk’s (1993) district-level measure is included as an indicator of interparty competition.\npublic_env: Indication of public attitudes toward environmental protection in the state. It is calculated from the 1988–1992 NES Senate Election Study, which asked the following question: “Should federal spending on the environment be increased, decreased, or stay the same?” Individual responses are coded 1 (decrease), 2 (same), and 3 (increase) and then averaged.\nmanuf_groups: The number of manufacturing groups registered to lobby in the state in 1990 standardized by gross state product to account for the fact that the density of organized interests is greater in states with larger economies.\nenv_groups: The number of environmental groups registered to lobby in the state in 1990 standardized by gross state product to account for the fact that the density of organized interests is greater in states with larger economies."

Learn how to do this in a code chunk using knitr syntax.\nAny typed mathematics (equations, matrices, vectors, etc.) should be appropriately typeset within the document using Markdown’s equation typesetting. See here for some examples of how mathematics can be typeset in R Markdown.\nAll syntax should be hidden (i.e., not displayed) unless specifically asked for.\nAny messages or warnings produced (e.g., from loading packages) should also be hidden.\n\nFor each question, specify the question number (e.g., Question 2) using a level-2 (or smaller) header. Submit both the QMD and knitted HTML file. This assignment is worth 15 points.\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nImport the data and display the first several rows of data (not all of it). Use one of the paged table options in your YAML to ensure that this is printed nicely. All syntax for these commands should be displayed, as should the output.\nCreate a well-formatted table that includes the mean infant mortality rate and the standard deviation of infant mortality rates for each region represented in the data. Display these in a summary table. All numerical output should be rounded to two decimal places. Also add an appropriate caption (the caption does not have to follow APA formatting). Do not display any syntax.\nRecode the gni_class variable by creating a dummy variable called high_gni. In this dummy variable recode the two categories “Upper/Middle” and “Upper” to be 1, and recode “Low/Middle” and “Low” to be 0. Use the lm() function to fit a main effects linear model regressing infant mortality on your dummy variable and female education level. Use the tidy() function from the broom package to display the model’s coefficient-level output. (Reminder: Do not display any syntax, only the model’s coefficient-level output.)\nUse a bulleted list to provide an interpretation of each estimated regression coefficient (including the intercept) from the regression you fitted in Question 3; one interpretation per list item.\nCreate a well-formatted table of the model’s coefficient tidy() output (e.g., using the kable() function from the knitr package). In the final outputted table, the five column names should be “Predictor”, “B”, “SE”, “t”, and “p”, respectively. All numerical output should be rounded to two decimal places, except the p-values, which should be rounded to three decimal places. Also add a caption. (2pts.)\nCreate a publication quality plot that displays the results from the fitted model. For this plot, put the female education level predictor on the x-axis. Display a separate line for each level of the dummy-coded GNI variable. The two lines should be displayed using different linetypes or colors (or both) so that they can be easily differentiated in the plot. Be sure that the figure includes a caption using the fig-cap option in the code chunk. The plot should be centered on the page. Adjust the aspect ratio of the plot using fig-width and fig-height in the code chunk so that it looks good. Lastly, change the values of the output width/height (out-width, out-height) to change the size of the plot from the default values. (2pts.)\nUse a display equation to write the equation for the underlying regression model (including error and assumptions) using Greek letters, subscripts, and variable names. Also write the equation for the fitted least squares regression equation based on the output from lm(). Type these two equations in the same display equation, each on a separate line of text in your document, and align the equals signs. (Hint: Google “aligning math latex”.) (2pts.)\nWrite the following sentence: “The estimated partial regression coefficient (\\(\\hat\\beta_\\mathrm{Female~Education}\\)) is \\(x\\).” In this sentence, use an inline code chunk to replace \\(x\\) with the value for the fitted coefficient from the fitted equation. In this code chunk, do not just write in the value for the coefficient, but use syntax to extract the value from the tidy() output. (Hint: Google “R extract element from dataframe”.) (2pts.)\nCompute the sum of squared residuals for the fitted regression. Although you can use the anova() function to check your work, compute this value by actually using R syntax to carry out the computation, \\(\\sum(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\\). Show the syntax you used in your document.\nWrite a sentence that includes two references in an inline citation. This should also generate the actual references when you knit your document. One of the two references should be the Fox textbook. The other should be a journal article of your choice. You can choose the topic of the sentence and how the two references are used in the citation. (Note the references do not actually have to pertain to what is written in the sentence. This is just an exercise in using the bibliography tools in Markdown.) The two references can be included in the document’s YAML (be careful of the indentation) or drawn from an external BIB file. Specify an appropriate CSL file so that the references and citations are in APA format. (If you want to use a citation style that is different from APA, say for a specific journal, use the appropriate CSL file, and indicate that on the assignment.) (2pts.)"

    "text": "Anatomy of a Table\nAny table is essentially a rectangular layout (rows and columns) of information. Below I show two common tables of statistical output taken from @apa:2020. I have also added guide-lines to show the rectangular display of information within each of these tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo illustrate how to create a table in the QMD document, we will attempt to recreate the following table. I have identified different aspect of this table that I will refer to throughout the notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the fact that data frames are also rectangular displays of information to create a table in the QMD document. The data.frame() function is used to enter the cell information from each column. This is, of course, done in a code chunk.\n\n# Input cell information\ntab_01 = data.frame(\n  scale = c(\"BAS-T\", \"SR\", \"BDI\", \"ASRM\", \"M-SRM\"),\n  high = c(\"46.17 (2.87)\", \"17.94 (1.88)\", \n           \"7.11 (6.50)\", \"6.46 (4.01)\", \"11.05 (3.36)\"),\n  mod = c(\"37.99 (1.32)\", \"11.52 (1.84)\", \n          \"6.18 (6.09)\", \"5.63 (3.69)\", \"11.76 (2.75)\"),\n  p = c(\"<.001\", \"<.001\", \".254\", \".109\", \".078\")\n  \n)\n\n# Show output\ntab_01\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nOnce you have the cell information in a data frame, all the rest of the syntax is formatting, adding a caption, changing column names, etc. There are several R packages that can be used to add this formatting.

For example, we could remove the horizontal lines in the table. These lines are called “borders” and we can modify them in the tab_style() function. This is a general function that allows us to customize many parts of the table (akin to theme() in ggplot()).\nTo do this we use the style= argument and call the cell_borders() function within tab_style(). Here we remove all borders (top, bottom, left, and right) by using sides=\"all\" and setting style=NULL. The tab_style() function also requires the argument locations=. We give this argument the function cell_body() which we provide the column and row numbers that we want to remove the borders from. Since we want to keep the horizontal border associated with the first and last rows, we omit those row numbers from the rows= argument.\n\n# Add title and subtitle\ntab_01 |>\n  gt() |>\n  cols_label(\n    variable = md(\"*Variable*\"),\n    m = md(\"*M*\"),\n    sd = md(\"*SD*\"),\n    min = md(\"*Min.*\"),\n    max = md(\"*Max.*\")\n  ) |>\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(variable),\n    align = \"left\"\n  ) |>\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(m, sd, min, max),\n    align = \"center\"\n  ) |>\n    tab_header(\n    title = md(\"**Table 1.** Summary statistics for the unstandardized outcome, focal predictor, and five covariates.\"),\n  ) |>\n  opt_align_table_header(\"left\")  |>\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_borders(\n      sides = \"all\", \n      style = NULL\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = 1:5,\n      rows = 2:6\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Table 1.

To do this we include the different citation identifiers separated by a semicolon.\nHere are multiple citations [@ross_2020; @carmichael_1954].\nThe output of this is:\n\nHere are multiple citations (Carmichael, 1954; Ross et al., 2020).\n\nWe can also change the format of the citation.
