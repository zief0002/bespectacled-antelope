    "text": "The goal of this assignment is to give you experience using Quarto to integrate analysis and documentation. In this assignment, you will use the data from the file fertility.csv to explain variation in infant mortality rates.\n\n[CSV]\n[Data Codebook]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\nCreate a QMD document to respond to each of the questions below. Please adhere to the following guidelines for further formatting your assignment:\n\nAll graphics should be resized so that they do not take up more room than necessary and should have an appropriate caption. Learn how to do this in a code chunk using knitr syntax.\nAny typed mathematics (equations, matrices, vectors, etc.) should be appropriately typeset within the document using Markdown’s equation typesetting. See here for some examples of how mathematics can be typeset in R Markdown.\nAll syntax should be hidden (i.e., not displayed) unless specifically asked for.\nAny messages or warnings produced (e.g., from loading packages) should also be hidden.\n\nFor each question, specify the question number (e.g., Question 2) using a level-2 (or smaller) header. Submit both the QMD and knitted HTML file. This assignment is worth 15 points.\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nImport the data and display the first several rows of data (not all of it). Use one of the paged table options in your YAML to ensure that this is printed nicely. All syntax for these commands should be displayed, as should the output.\nCreate a well-formatted table that includes the mean infant mortality rate and the standard deviation of infant mortality rates for each region represented in the data. Display these in a summary table. All numerical output should be rounded to two decimal places. Also add an appropriate caption (the caption does not have to follow APA formatting). Do not display any syntax.\nRecode the gni_class variable by creating a dummy variable called high_gni. To create this use the syntax below. Explain in words (not code) how the high_gni dummy variable is being coded.\n\n\nfertility = fertility |>\n  mutate(\n    high_gni = if_else(gni_class == \"Upper/Middle\" | gni_class == \"Upper\", 1, 0)\n  )\n\n\nUse the lm() function to fit a main effects linear model (unstandardized) regressing infant mortality on your dummy variable and female education level. Use the tidy() function from the broom package to display the model’s coefficient-level output. (Reminder: Do not display any syntax, only the model’s coefficient-level output.)\nUse a bulleted list to provide an interpretation of each estimated regression coefficient (including the intercept) from the regression you fitted in Question 3; one interpretation per list item.\nCreate a well-formatted table of the model’s coefficient tidy() output (e.g., using the gt() function from the {gt} package). In the final outputted table, the five column names should be “Predictor”, “B”, “SE”, “t”, and “p”, respectively. The last four column names should be italicized since they are statistics. All numerical output should be rounded to two decimal places, except the p-values, which should be rounded to three decimal places. Also add a caption. (2pts.)\nCreate a publication quality plot that displays the results from the fitted model. For this plot, put the female education level predictor on the x-axis. Display a separate line for each level of the dummy-coded GNI variable. The two lines should be displayed using different linetypes or colors (or both) so that they can be easily differentiated in the plot. Be sure that the figure includes a caption using the fig-cap option in the code chunk. The plot should be centered on the page. Adjust the aspect ratio of the plot using fig-width and fig-height in the code chunk so that it looks good. Lastly, change the values of the output width/height (out-width, out-height) to change the size of the plot from the default values. (2pts.)\nUse a display equation to write the equation for the underlying regression model (including error and assumptions) using Greek letters, subscripts, and variable names. Also write the equation for the fitted least squares regression equation based on the output from lm(). Type these two equations in the same display equation, each on a separate line of text in your document, and align the equals signs. (2pts.)\nWrite the following sentence: “The estimated partial regression coefficient (\\(\\hat\\beta_\\mathrm{Female~Education}\\)) is \\(x\\).” In this sentence, use an inline code chunk to replace \\(x\\) with the value for the fitted coefficient from the fitted equation. In this code chunk, do not just write in the value for the coefficient, but use syntax to extract the value from the tidy() output. (Hint: Google “R extract element from dataframe”.) (2pts.)\nCompute the sum of squared residuals for the fitted regression. Although you can use the anova() function to check your work, compute this value by actually using R syntax to carry out the computation, \\(\\sum(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\\). Show the syntax you used in your document.\nWrite a sentence that includes two references in an inline citation. This should also generate the actual references when you knit your document. One of the two references should be the Fox textbook. The other should be a journal article of your choice. You can choose the topic of the sentence and how the two references are used in the citation. (Note the references do not actually have to pertain to what is written in the sentence. This is just an exercise in using the bibliography tools in Markdown.) The two references can be included in the document’s YAML (be careful of the indentation) or drawn from an external BIB file. Specify an appropriate CSL file so that the references and citations are in APA format. (If you want to use a citation style that is different from APA, say for a specific journal, use the appropriate CSL file, and indicate that on the assignment.) (2pts.)\n\n\n\nWhat to Submit\nYou need to submit a zipped version of your entire assignment-01 project directory. When the TA unzips this and opens your R project file they will render your QMD document. This should produce the HTML file that will be graded. (You can include your HTML file as an extra attachment if you want, but the QMD document will need to render. If it doesn’t render the TA will return it to you to try again.)\nWhen you are ready to submit, you"

I have also added guide-lines to show the rectangular display of information within each of these tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo illustrate how to create a table in the QMD document, we will attempt to recreate the following table. I have identified different aspect of this table that I will refer to throughout the notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the fact that data frames are also rectangular displays of information to create a table in the QMD document. The data.frame() function is used to enter the cell information from each column. This is, of course, done in a code chunk.\n\n# Input cell information\ntab_01 = data.frame(\n  scale = c(\"BAS-T\", \"SR\", \"BDI\", \"ASRM\", \"M-SRM\"),\n  high = c(\"46.17 (2.87)\", \"17.94 (1.88)\", \n           \"7.11 (6.50)\", \"6.46 (4.01)\", \"11.05 (3.36)\"),\n  mod = c(\"37.99 (1.32)\", \"11.52 (1.84)\", \n          \"6.18 (6.09)\", \"5.63 (3.69)\", \"11.76 (2.75)\"),\n  p = c(\"<.001\", \"<.001\", \".254\", \".109\", \".078\")\n  \n)\n\n# Show output\ntab_01\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nOnce you have the cell information in a data frame, all the rest of the syntax is formatting, adding a caption, changing column names, etc. There are several R packages that can be used to add this formatting.

In this assignment, you will use the data from the file fertility.csv to explain variation in infant mortality rates.\n\n[CSV]\n[Data Codebook]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\nCreate a QMD document to respond to each of the questions below. Please adhere to the following guidelines for further formatting your assignment:\n\nAll graphics should be resized so that they do not take up more room than necessary and should have an appropriate caption. Learn how to do this in a code chunk using knitr syntax.\nAny typed mathematics (equations, matrices, vectors, etc.) should be appropriately typeset within the document using Markdown’s equation typesetting. See here for some examples of how mathematics can be typeset in R Markdown.\nAll syntax should be hidden (i.e., not displayed) unless specifically asked for.\nAny messages or warnings produced (e.g., from loading packages) should also be hidden.\n\nFor each question, specify the question number (e.g., Question 2) using a level-2 (or smaller) header. Submit both the QMD and knitted HTML file. This assignment is worth 15 points.\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nImport the data and display the first several rows of data (not all of it). Use one of the paged table options in your YAML to ensure that this is printed nicely. All syntax for these commands should be displayed, as should the output.\nCreate a well-formatted table that includes the mean infant mortality rate and the standard deviation of infant mortality rates for each region represented in the data. Display these in a summary table. All numerical output should be rounded to two decimal places. Also add an appropriate caption (the caption does not have to follow APA formatting). Do not display any syntax.\nRecode the gni_class variable by creating a dummy variable called high_gni. To create this dummy variable use the syntax below. Explain in words (not code) how the high_gni dummy variable is being coded.\n\n\nfertility = fertility |>\n  mutate(\n    high_gni = if_else(gni_class == \"Upper/Middle\" | gni_class == \"Upper\", 1, 0)\n  )\n\n\nUse the lm() function to fit a main effects linear model (unstandardized) regressing infant mortality on your dummy variable and female education level. Use the tidy() function from the broom package to display the model’s coefficient-level output. (Reminder: Do not display any syntax, only the model’s coefficient-level output.)\nUse a bulleted list to provide an interpretation of each estimated regression coefficient (including the intercept) from the regression you fitted in Question 3; one interpretation per list item.\nCreate a well-formatted table of the model’s coefficient tidy() output (e.g., using the gt() function from the {gt} package). In the final outputted table, the five column names should be “Predictor”, “B”, “SE”, “t”, and “p”, respectively. The last four column names should be italicized since they are statistics. All numerical output should be rounded to two decimal places, except the p-values, which should be rounded to three decimal places. Also add a caption. (2pts.)\nCreate a publication quality plot that displays the results from the fitted model. For this plot, put the female education level predictor on the x-axis. Display a separate line for each level of the dummy-coded GNI variable. The two lines should be displayed using different linetypes or colors (or both) so that they can be easily differentiated in the plot. Be sure that the figure includes a caption using the fig-cap option in the code chunk. The plot should be centered on the page. Adjust the aspect ratio of the plot using fig-width and fig-height in the code chunk so that it looks good. Lastly, change the values of the output width/height (out-width, out-height) to change the size of the plot from the default values. (2pts.)\nUse a display equation to write the equation for the underlying regression model (including error and assumptions) using Greek letters, subscripts, and variable names. Also write the equation for the fitted least squares regression equation based on the output from lm(). Type these two equations in the same display equation, each on a separate line of text in your document, and align the equals signs. (2pts.)\nWrite the following sentence: “The estimated partial regression coefficient (\\(\\hat\\beta_\\mathrm{Female~Education}\\)) is \\(x\\).” In this sentence, use an inline code chunk to replace \\(x\\) with the value for the fitted coefficient from the fitted equation. In this code chunk, do not just write in the value for the coefficient, but use syntax to extract the value from the tidy() output. (Hint: Google “R extract element from dataframe”.) (2pts.)\nCompute the sum of squared residuals for the fitted regression. Although you can use the anova() function to check your work, compute this value by actually using R syntax to carry out the computation, \\(\\sum(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\\). Show the syntax you used in your document.\nWrite a sentence that includes two references in an inline citation. This should also generate the actual references when you knit your document. One of the two references should be the Fox textbook. The other should be a journal article of your choice. You can choose the topic of the sentence and how the two references are used in the citation. (Note the references do not actually have to pertain to what is written in the sentence. This is just an exercise in using the bibliography tools in Markdown.) Specify an appropriate CSL file so that the references and citations are in APA format. (If you want to use a citation style that is different from APA, say for a specific journal, use the appropriate CSL file, and indicate that on the assignment.) Both the BIB and CSL files should be included in your project’s assets directory. (2pts.)\n\n\n\nWhat to Submit\nYou need to submit a zipped version of your entire assignment-01 project directory. When the TA unzips this and opens your R project file they will render your QMD document. This should produce the HTML file that will be graded. (You can include your HTML file as an extra attachment if you want, but the QMD document will need to render. If it doesn’t render the TA will return it to you to try again.)"

In this study, we will fit the same candidate models that Snipes and Taylor fitted in their analysis, however we will be using a different data set (e.g., our data includes more regions than Snipes and Taylor’s data). We will also make one change in the analysis, and that is we will treat vintage as a continuous variable; we won’t categorize it like Snipes and Taylor did. By using a different set of data and making slightly different analytic decisions we can more vigorously evaluate the underlying working hypotheses.\nFit the same nine candidate models that Snipes and Taylor fitted in their analysis, using the wine.csv data. In these models use wine rating (rating) as the outcome. Remember to treat vintage as a continuous variable in the models that include it. These models will be named Model 0, Model 1, …, Model 8 to be consistent with the naming in the Snipes and Taylor paper. Use these fitted models to answer the questions in the assignment."

    "text": "Effect of Religious Service Attendance\nYou will begin the analysis by examining the effect of religious service attendance on support of same-sex marriage. Because the data for this predictor come from a Likert scale (ordinal in nature), we need to examine whether we can treat it as a continuous predictor in the model, or whether we should treat it as categorical.\n\nBegin by computing the empirical proportion of people that support same-sex marriage for each of the attendance categories. Create a line plot that shows the relationship between proportion of support and attendance.\n\nBased on the plot you just created, the relationship between proportion of support and attendance seems linear. Because of this, we can treat the Likert data as continuous; using a line (or polynomial) to fit the relationship. The only caution being that when interpreting a slope, we say something like, “a one-unit difference in \\(X\\) is associated with a \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\)-unit difference in \\(Y\\)”. For ordinal (Likert) data a one-unit difference in \\(X\\) really indicates a shift from one category to the next highest category.\n\nFit two logistic models to the data using religious service attendance. In the first model, only include the linear effect of attendance. In the second model, include both a linear and quadratic effect to predict variation in support for same-sex marriage. Which model should be adopted (linear or quadratic)? Justify your response by providing any statistical evidence you used in reaching your decision. (Note: The model you adopt here will be henceforth referred to as Model 1.)\n\n\n\n\nWrite the fitted equation for Model 1. (Don’t forget to include all appropriate subscripts. Also define any terms in the model that are ambiguous.)\nUse the fitted equation for Model 1 to predict the (a) log-odds, (b) odds, and (c) probability of someone supporting same-sex marriage if that person attends religious services almost every week."

By referring to this matrix, clearly indicate the order in which you will add covariates into the model.\n\nFit three logistic models based on the order of importance of the three covariates that also include the effects of religious attendance, and denomination. For example, the first of these three models would include the effects of religious attendance, denomination, and the most important covariate you identifed in Question 8. The second model would include the effects of religious attendance, denomination, and the two most important covariates you identified.
